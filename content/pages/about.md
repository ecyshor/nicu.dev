Software engineer living in Zürich, Switzerland.

Coding for work mostly in Scala, in my free time using VueJS, Typescript, some go here and there and currently doing some dives into rust.

Got a collection of raspberry pies I'm tinkering with, and trying to find the time to build a kubernetes cluster out of them (because why not). 

When not coding you'll find me cycling, hiking or skiing.
