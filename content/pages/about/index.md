Software engineer living in ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland.

Coding for work mostly in Scala, in my free time using VueJS, Typescript, some go here and there and currently doing some dives into rust.

Got a collection of raspberry pies I'm tinkering with, and trying to find the time to build a kubernetes cluster out of them (because why not). 

When not coding you'll find me cycling, hiking or skiing.
